  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This GPT Action is designed to retrieve bibliometric data (e.g., Journal Impact Factor) based on journal names provided by the user. The following outlines our data practices:</p>

  <h2>Data Handling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Journal Name Transmission:</strong> When a user provides a journal name, it is sent to a secure backend server hosted on <a href="https://render.com">Render.com</a>, located in Frankfurt, Germany (European data center).</li>
    <li><strong>Data Retrieval:</strong> The server queries an external API to retrieve Journal Citation Report (JCR) data associated with the given journal name, including metrics such as Journal Impact Factor (JIF) and 5-Year JIF.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Personal Data</h2>
  <p>This GPT Action does not collect, store, or process any personal or identifiable information from users.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>No data is shared with third parties beyond the journal name being transmitted to the JCR API provider for information retrieval. No information is stored or reused across sessions.</p>

  <h2>Hosting Location</h2>
  <p>The backend infrastructure is hosted on Renderâ€™s European region (Frankfurt, Germany), ensuring data residency within the EU.</p>

  <h2>Compliance</h2>
  <p>This GPT Action complies with GDPR principles by avoiding personal data collection, using secure HTTPS communication, and minimizing data usage to the journal name only.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact the developer via the GPT Action listing page.</p>
